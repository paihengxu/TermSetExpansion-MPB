# general configs are used when directly running MPB1 or MPB2 and when running run_experiments.

# - corpus_dir is the path to the directory that contains a directory named "textFiles" with all text files and an "indexer" directory if using an indexer.
# - num_of_sentences: number of corpus sentences to search for indicative patterns in
# - num_of_indicative_patterns: number of indicative patterns the algorithm uses
# - size_of_expanded: size_of_expanded set the algorithm returns.
# - use_indexer: True if an indexer for corpus searching is available.
# - batch_size: size of batch for BERT
# -set_file: path to text file containing the set. assuming each row in the file contains comma separated synonyms
# that represent the same term and multi words terms are separated by "_", for instance a row can be: "NY, New_York"
# - seed: seed terms to expand
